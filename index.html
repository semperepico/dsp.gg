    <h2>Diary</h2>
    <h3>Monday 26th of June 2023</h3>
    <p>
        I've formulated my own version of the 75 hard challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
        As part of it, I have committed to code 4 hours per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        This diary will serve as a summary and revision of what I learned and accomplished each day.
    </p>
    <p>
       My main source of study material is <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"" target=_blank>The Odin Project</a> 
    </p>
    <p>
       The Odin Project is a great project based curriculum which you can use to learn the foundations of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
       and then choose to specialise in JavaScript using React and Node or Ruby with Ruby on Rails. I highly recommend it as the curriculum mixes
       original content with some of the best resources on the internet for learning web development.
    </p>
    <p>
       But, instead of doing the random generic projects that it suggests, I am applying the instructions to creating my own website
       from scratch. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's what I learned today:
    </p>
    <ol><li>CSS Specificity</li>
    <ul>
        <li>ID selectors have a higher specificity score than class selectors which have a higher specificity score than element selectors</li>
        <li>If there is a tie-break in specificity ranking then the last written style (measured from top to bottom) in the CSS will be applied</li>
        <li>Universal selectors (like '*') have no specificity ranking</li>
    </ul>
    <li>How to publish my website using GitHub Pages</li>
    <li>Some VS Code shortcuts such as how to change multiple lines at a time (option+shift+i on mac)
        and opening a terminal window (control+shift+backtick)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Here's what I repeated today:
    </p>
    <ol><li>Git</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Creating a new repository in GitHub</li>
    <li>Git add (adds file to a repository)</li>
    <li>Git commit -m (commits changes with a commit message)</li>
    <li>Git push (pushes your changes to the master/main branch)</li>
    <br>
    </ul>
    <li>HTML Elements - HTML is simple and self-explanatory so I will not go into all the details
        but this includes the HTML for this website.
    </li>
    <li>Working from the command line: mkdir, touch, vi, rm -rf, mv, code. Here's a great a great 
        <a href="https://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf" target="_blank">command line cheatsheet</li>
